FOR STANDARDISATION PURPOSES AND ORGANIZATION


variable names are as follow:

server - guild as a parameter or on its own but server when using serverid, name etc
message - msg as a parameter (other people use ctx) or message when in command
channel - channel or specific use cases (messagechannel for example)
user - member 
id - always use the use case (serverid, memberid, messageid etc.)

I WILL BE STRICT WITH THE RULES ABOVE


libraries:
if you want to use an external library such as pillow, mysql.connector, discord.py etc that are not stock with python
ask me directly and I will do some research.

THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF ANYONE ELSE DOES NOT HAVE THE APPROPRIATE LIBRARY THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN THE BOT


WORKING TOGETHER:

command names:
if you think there is a better command name tell everyone and the majority vote wins.

features:
for feature requests do it directly on github and everyone can give their feedback.

commenting:
when programming a command explain what and why with comments.
